    Inner join countries (left) and populations (right) on the code and country_code fields respectively.
    Alias countries AS c and populations AS p.
    Select code, name, and region from countries and also select year and fertility_rate from populations (5 fields in total).

-- Select fields
SELECT c.code, name, region, year, fertility_rate
  -- From countries (alias as c)
  FROM countries AS c
  -- Join with populations (as p)
  INNER JOIN populations AS p
    -- Match on country code
    ON c.code = p.country_code;
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Add an additional INNER JOIN with economies to your previous query by joining on code.
    Include the unemployment_rate column that became available through joining with economies.
    Note that year appears in both populations and economies, so you have to explicitly use e.year instead of year as you did before.

-- Select fields
SELECT c.code, name, region, e.year, fertility_rate, unemployment_rate
  -- From countries (alias as c)
  FROM countries AS c
  -- Join to populations (as p)
  INNER JOIN populations AS p
    -- Match on country code
    ON c.code = p.country_code
  -- Join to economies (as e)
  INNER JOIN economies as e
    -- Match on country code
    ON c.code = e.code;

    Scroll down the query result and take a look at the results for Albania from your previous query. Does something seem off to you?
    The trouble with doing your last join on c.code = e.code and not also including year is that e.g. the 2010 value for fertility_rate is also paired with the 2015 value for unemployment_rate.
    Fix your previous query: in your last ON clause, use AND to add an additional joining condition. In addition to joining on code in c and e, also join on year in e and p.


    -- Select fields
SELECT c.code, name, region, e.year, fertility_rate, unemployment_rate
  -- From countries (alias as c)
  FROM countries AS c
  -- Join to populations (as p)
  INNER JOIN populations AS p
    -- Match on country code
    ON c.code = p.country_code
  -- Join to economies (as e)
  INNER JOIN economies AS e
    -- Match on country code and year
    ON c.code = e.code AND e.year = p.year;
